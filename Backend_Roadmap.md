# Axiomancer Backend Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines all the game mechanics that need to be implemented in the backend. Since calculations will happen on the frontend, the backend focuses on character persistence and game state management.

- Character progression and leveling system
- Character portrait and appearance data storage
- Character authentication and ownership validation

### Backend Requirements:
- Character model with all stats and metadata
- Character creation endpoint
- Character retrieval endpoint
- Character update endpoint
- Character deletion endpoint

## 2. Game State Management
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Persistent game world state and player progress tracking.

### Features to Implement:
- Player location tracking (current map, coordinates)

- Story progression markers and unlocked areas
- Save/load game functionality
- Multiple save slots per user

### Backend Requirements:
- GameState model with location and progression data
- Get game state endpoint
- Update game state endpoint
- Save game endpoint
- Load game endpoint

## Implementation Priority Order
1. **Phase 1 (Critical):** Character Management + Game State Management
2. **Phase 2 (Core Gameplay):** Inventory System + Combat Data
3. **Phase 3 (World Building):** Exploration + Location System
4. **Phase 4 (Advanced Features):** Faction System + Quest System
5. **Phase 5 (Special Mechanics):** Demon Contracts + Boat Building + Labyrinth

## Technical Notes
- All game calculations will be handled on the frontend
- Backend serves as persistent storage and state management
- RESTful API design with proper error handling
- MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Proper authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- Data validation using Zod schemas
