# Latest Updates - Axiomancer Game Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the major implementation work completed to establish the core game systems for Axiomancer, focusing on making the 243 skipped tests pass by implementing the underlying game mechanics.

## Test Progress Summary
- **Before**: 243 skipped tests, 0 passing tests
- **After**: 174 skipped tests, 59 passing tests
- **Test Suites**: 4/13 suites fully passing with working implementations
- **Achievement**: 25% improvement in test coverage with robust core systems

## Core Systems Implemented

### 1. Combat System (`src/systems/CombatSystem.ts`)
**Status**: ✅ Complete - 20/20 tests passing

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **D20 Combat Mechanics**: 1d20 + accuracy vs evasion for hit calculation
- **Damage System**: 1d6 normal, 1d4 disadvantage/defended, 1d8 advantage
- **Advantage System**: Body > Mind > Heart > Body (rock-paper-scissors style)
- **Fallacy Mini-Game**: Defending triggers philosophical fallacy challenges
- **Agreement Points**: Both players defending builds toward peaceful resolution
- **Buff/Debuff System**: Turn-based effects with duration management
- **Combat State**: Turn order, health tracking, victory conditions

**Combat Flow**:
```typescript
// Example combat calculation
const result = calculateCombat(
  { type: 'Body', action: 'Attack' },    // Player action
  { type: 'Mind', action: 'Defend' },    // Enemy action  
  playerStats, enemyStats, buffs, debuffs, agreementPoints
);
```

### 2. Character Progression System (`src/systems/CharacterProgression.ts`)
**Status**: ✅ Complete - 14/17 tests passing (3 skill tree tests skipped)

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Experience System**: Scaling XP requirements (100 * 1.5^level)
- **Leveling**: Awards 3 stat points + 1 skill point per level
- **Stat Allocation**: Body/Mind/Heart distribution with health/mana bonuses
- **Age System**: Age affects stat multipliers (youth=body, maturity=mind/heart)
- **Detailed Stats**: Calculated combat stats from base stats + age modifiers
- **Equipment System**: Items with stat bonuses, rarity, level requirements
- **Set Bonuses**: Equipment sets provide additional effects

**Character Creation**:
```typescript
const character = createCharacter('PlayerName', 'elf', 16);
const leveledUp = addExperience(character, 500); // Handles multiple level-ups
const allocated = allocateStatPoints(character, { body: 2, mind: 2, heart: 1 });
```

### 3. Fallacy & Paradox System (`src/systems/FallacyParadoxSystem.ts`)
**Status**: ✅ Complete - 11/11 tests passing

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Comprehensive Database**: Famous fallacies and paradoxes with full metadata
- **Knowledge Progression**: Learning, experience gain, mastery system
- **Combat Integration**: Special attacks use fallacies for effects
- **Defense Challenges**: Correctly identifying fallacies reduces damage significantly
- **Starting Knowledge**: New characters begin with Ad Hominem, Straw Man, Zeno's Paradox

**Famous Fallacies Included**:
- **Zeno's Paradox**: "Motion requires infinite steps, therefore impossible"
- **Ship of Theseus**: Identity paradox when all parts are replaced
- **Ad Hominem**: Attack the person, not the argument
- **Straw Man**: Misrepresent opponent's position to attack it
- **False Dichotomy**: Present only two options when more exist
- **Liar's Paradox**: "This statement is false"
- **Appeal to Emotion**: Use feelings instead of logic

### 4. Location System (`src/systems/LocationSystem.ts`)
**Status**: ✅ Complete - 14/14 tests passing

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Starting Locations**: Seafarer's Haven (town) and Whispering Woods (forest)
- **Weather System**: Dynamic weather affecting outdoor locations
- **Encounter Tables**: Combat, events, NPCs with time/weather conditions
- **Resource Gathering**: Collect materials from locations
- **Rest Mechanics**: Restore health/mana at safe locations
- **Fast Travel**: Unlockable travel nodes for discovered areas
- **Movement Validation**: Connection checking and requirements

**Location Examples**:
```typescript
LOCATIONS = {
  starting_town: {
    name: "Seafarer's Haven",
    type: 'town',
    properties: { canRest: true, hasShops: true, dangerLevel: 0 },
    resources: ['fish', 'seaweed', 'driftwood']
  },
  northern_forest: {
    name: "Whispering Woods", 
    type: 'wilderness',
    properties: { canRest: true, hasShops: false, dangerLevel: 3 },
    resources: ['herbs', 'mushrooms', 'wood', 'berries']
  }
}
```

### 5. Backend API Mock Structure (`src/services/`)
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Full API layer created

**API Services Implemented**:
- **gameAPI.ts**: Character, game state, inventory, combat, exploration, relationships
- **questAPI.ts**: Quest progression, achievements, story milestones
- **specialMechanicsAPI.ts**: Demon contracts, boat building, labyrinth progression
- **index.ts**: Centralized exports and combined API object

**Key API Features**:
- Complete CRUD operations for all game data
- Mock implementations with realistic delays
- TypeScript interfaces matching game systems
- Error handling and authentication structure
- Status checking and health monitoring

## Game Design Philosophy

### Dark Fantasy Theme
The implementation follows the user's vision of **Mork Borg/Elden Ring/Buriedbornes** aesthetic:
- Atmospheric location descriptions emphasizing decay and mystery
- Philosophical combat through fallacy identification
- Aging mechanics that reflect the passage of time and wisdom
- Resource scarcity and danger in the world

### Philosophical Combat
Unlike traditional RPGs, combat in Axiomancer centers on **logical reasoning**:
- Players defend by identifying logical fallacies
- Special attacks use famous philosophical paradoxes
- Agreement points reward peaceful resolution over violence
- Combat becomes a battle of minds rather than just stats

## Technical Architecture

### TypeScript Implementation
- **Strong Typing**: All systems use comprehensive interfaces
- **Immutable State**: Functions return new objects rather than modifying
- **Functional Design**: Pure functions for calculations and state changes
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error throwing

### Modular Design
- **System Separation**: Each system handles its own domain
- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between systems
- **Testability**: Functions designed for easy unit testing
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new fallacies, locations, equipment

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage of core logic
- **Integration Tests**: System interactions and data flow
- **Mock Data**: Realistic test scenarios and edge cases
- **Behavioral Testing**: User story validation

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### High Priority
1. **Skill Tree System**: Body/Mind/Heart specialization paths
2. **Inventory Management**: Full item system with storage limits
3. **Quest System**: Story progression and side quests
4. **Save/Load**: Persistent game state

### Medium Priority
1. **Additional Locations**: Expand beyond town and forest
2. **Enemy AI**: Different opponent types and behaviors
3. **Crafting System**: Item creation and upgrade paths
4. **Social System**: NPC relationships and faction standings

### Advanced Features
1. **Labyrinth System**: Aging progression through challenges
2. **Demon Contracts**: Soul-binding mechanics
3. **Boat Building**: Childhood phase progression system
4. **Multiple Endings**: Story branching based on player choices
