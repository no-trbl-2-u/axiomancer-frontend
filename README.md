## Game Overview

### What is Axiomancer?
Axiomancer is a philosophical RPG that blends dark fantasy aesthetics with unique intellectual combat mechanics. Instead of traditional sword-and-sorcery combat, players engage in **philosophical warfare** using logical fallacies, paradoxes, and rhetorical strategies.

### Core Theme
- **Visual Style**: Dark fantasy inspired by Mork Borg, Elden Ring, and BuriedBornes
- **Combat System**: Rock-paper-scissors mechanics with Body > Mind > Heart > Body
- **Philosophical Depth**: Combat uses logical fallacies and paradoxes as "spells"
- **Moral Complexity**: Demon contracts, faction alignment, and multiple endings

### Three-Phase Journey
1. **Childhood (Boat Building)**: Peaceful exploration, collect boat pieces in starting town
2. **Labyrinth (Aging)**: Navigate chambers that age you 1 year each, gain wisdom
3. **Adulthood (Empire Politics)**: Use knowledge to become King's advisor through faction warfare

## Core Game Mechanics

### Combat System
**Philosophy**: Combat is intellectual warfare using logical arguments

#### Basic Mechanics
- **Action Types**: Attack, Special Attack, Defend
- **Move Types**: Body (physical), Mind (logical), Heart (emotional)
- **Advantage System**: Body > Mind > Heart > Body (rock-paper-scissors)
- **Agreement Points**: Both defending = +1 point (3 = peaceful resolution)

#### Damage Calculation
- **Normal**: 1x damage
- **Advantage**: 1.5x damage multiplier
- **Disadvantage**: 0.5x damage multiplier
- **Defending**: Reduced damage taken

#### Fallacy Mini-Game
When a player defends, they face a fallacy identification challenge:
- **Correct Answer**: 75% damage reduction
- **Wrong Answer**: Full damage taken
- **Examples**: Ad Hominem, Straw Man, False Dichotomy, Zeno's Paradox

### Character Progression
#### Stats System
- **Body**: Physical prowess, affects health and combat damage
- **Mind**: Intellectual capacity, affects mana and mental attacks
- **Heart**: Social intelligence, affects charisma and emotional manipulation

#### Portrait System
Each race/portrait provides starting stat bonuses:
- **Elf**: Mind +1, Heart +1 (balanced intellectual/social)
- **Drake**: Body +2 (pure physical approach)
- **Arc-mage**: Mind +2 (pure intellectual approach)
- **Locked Portraits**: Stronger bonuses but require special unlock conditions

#### Aging Mechanics (Unique Feature)
Characters age through labyrinth progression with stat modifiers:
- **Youth (≤16)**: High body, low wisdom
- **Adult (17-40)**: Balanced stats
- **Elder (41+)**: High wisdom, reduced physicality

### Location System
#### Starting Areas
1. **Seafarer's Haven**: Peaceful fishing village, tutorial area
2. **Whispering Woods**: Dangerous forest with spirits and philosophers
3. **Labyrinth Entrance**: Requires boat to access
4. **Empire City**: Advanced civilization (end-game)
5. **Necronia**: Dark cultist city (special unlock)

#### Dynamic Elements
- **Weather Effects**: Impact visibility and encounters
- **Resource Gathering**: Location-specific materials
- **NPCs**: Unique characters with dialogue trees
- **Random Encounters**: Combat, events, philosophical debates
